Local Migrations
================

These are migrations that apply to local development only.
Therefore, they live here and don't get packaged into the app jar.
We'll probably only use this to seed data that's useful for development.

## Personal migration

You can make a migration just for yourself that won't be checked in.
See [R__Me.sql.example](R__Me.sql.example)
